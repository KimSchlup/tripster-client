# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

I basically added the interactive map, the sidebar with each correct button and the first poc ov a movable window as overlay for the GIS interface | Well, without the map, the project wouldn't be very interesting and this interface is the main interface for later userstories. |

Basically, cleaned work on different branches and harmonized into one single develop branch, to start from there anew. Removed a lot of code, which became unnecessary (like Banner.tsx, user/page.tsx, etc.). Harmonized a lot of request handling in the frontend, because it could finally be tested with a working version of the backend. Because of that, fixed some wrong variable names (like userID instead of just "id"). Additionaly added some smaller changes to the POIWindow, because the Title was off, when added to many Characters. Added Vercel Github Actions to all Pull Requests in main and Develop.  | Some of it wasn't in the retrospective (like Vercel Actions), but overall it works toward a working MVP. All At that time working backend functionalities are now working with the corresponding frontend components. |

Routes and POIs are now always shown. Thus removed this button. Moved "Create Route" Button within the RouteList Window, therefore removed another Button from the Vertical Sidebar on the left Side of the Screen, fixed some Bugs. | The earlisert feedback mentioned an unclear User Experience.

The ordering of the X and Y coordinates is now the same as when creating a route (which worked in the past without issues). Also removed some logging functions which are obsolete now since the basics work. | We are now able to update a route (either change the POI's used or the travel mode). Without that, there was a need for the user to constantly delete routes and create new routes which would have been tedious. |

Boundingbox can be edited or deleted. Check if poi is in boundingbox and error is shown if not in box.  |

The Layer Manager should help filter the Map Elements by different Attributes and make changing BaseMaps easier. | First of all, it is the last Button in the Map-UI, which wasn't implemented yet.. By filtering what should be shown on the map, it should help users in the planning process to remove unnecessary information from the map (like rejected POIs) and thus reduce map information content, if necessary. Or of course, search for very specific Information (e.g. only Sighteeing-POIs added by User XY) |

Now, every Map-Element is updated if someone changes something. The Welcome-Box contains a simple message as a Guide for the User, how to start. This is now tested and could be extended to a Tutorial in later stages. The rest just improves the UI generally. |

Frontend integraton of images in Roadtrip Overview, made components out of roadtrip cards.  | Sending strings instead of binaries saves a lot of bandwidth. Signed URL are more secure and allow limiting access.  |

Added deletion and image verification logic to frontend. Old image is also deleted if user adds new image. | Deleting images is important both for data protection and storage reasons. |
| **@RicoCamenzind** | 12.05.2025   | [Commit 1](https://github.com/KimSchlup/tripster-server/commit/de84f92f09adfce364e61faf44e7a81807189b0e) | Added the check if a POI is inside a bounding box. This method gets called before creating a new POI or before updating such. | Provides the functionality to add a boundingBox to restrict where new POI can be created. |
|                    | 13.05.2025   | [Commit 2](https://github.com/KimSchlup/tripster-server/commit/61403cbc6b439ec15d933e2edb7496c2d912421c) | First implementation of route ordering. The backend now supports ordering of the routes. Tests and the final implementation are yet to be done. | This allows the user to change the order of the routes to get a better overview of the total route of the roadtrip. |
